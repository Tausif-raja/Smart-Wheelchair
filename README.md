Overview

The Smart Wheelchair is an assistive device designed to enhance mobility and accessibility for individuals with disabilities. It integrates various IoT components such as sensors, actuators, and a microcontroller to provide efficient and reliable movement. The system is based on an Arduino Uno R3 board, utilizing:

Ultrasonic Sensor for obstacle detection

Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) for night detection

Flex Sensors for movement control

Servo Motors for mobility

LEDs and Buzzer for user feedback

The circuit was designed and simulated in Tinkercad before implementation, ensuring proper wiring and functionality. Arduino C++ was used to program movement logic and obstacle alerts. Testing included verifying movement accuracy, obstacle detection, and user interaction to ensure a reliable and efficient system that meets the needs of users with disabilities.

Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

This project aligns with the following United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure

SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

SDG 17: Partnership for the Goals

Aim of the Product

The Smart Wheelchair aims to assist individuals with mobility challenges due to age, injuries, or disabilities. It enhances their ability to move independently, reducing reliance on caregivers. The integration of IoT-based systems ensures smart mobility, with sensors like Ultrasonic Sensors and Flex Sensors, while LDR Sensors assist in low-light conditions.

Working Mechanism

This system integrates multiple sensors for optimized control and navigation:

Flex Sensors: Measure bending and control movement of micro servo motors.

Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects obstacles and triggers buzzer alerts for safe navigation.

LDR Sensor: Measures light levels and automates LED indicators.

LCD Screen: Displays real-time navigation feedback to the user.
